<p class='indexText'>Shepard Seaside Cottage is located just five miles from Freeport, far enough away for quiet summer afternoons but close enough to easily take advantage of activities in town.

Shepard Seaside was built in the early 1900s and retains the charm of an earlier era. But we've completely restored the house, so you can also enjoy all the comforts of today.

Our guests have free access to a canoe and four bicycles, handy for trips to nearby Audubon Bird Sanctuary at Mast Landing or to Wolfe's Neck State Park, a wonderful spot for hiking and picnicking.

And you're only a few minutes from quaint downtown Freeport, a shopper's paradise with hundreds of shops and outlets (including L.L. Bean) and fun activities for the whole family.

Perhaps best of all, the cottage sits on land that occupies both sides of a narrow peninsula. So you can enjoy spectacular ocean sunrises and sunsets without stirring from the property.

Take your time as you wander around our virtual tour of the cottage and surrounding area. Let seaside Maine cast its spell on you, just as it has on us. We think you'll enjoy your stay.
