                <p class='questionHeading'>Where can I  buy lobsters to eat?</p>

<p id='faqAnswer'>Many restaurants serve lobster.  If you would like to dine on lobsters outside by the Castco bay, then one option is to eat them by the wharf at the end of Maine Street in South Freeport.  This casual eatery is run by the Harraseeket Lunch and Lobster Company and is located three miles from LLBean.

<br><br>
<p id='faqAnswer' style='font-weight: bold;'>For purchasing lobster by the pound, the following are options:</p>  
Day's Crabmeat and Lobster Inc. (Limited hours but often the best prices)<br>
1269 US Route One Yarmouth, Maine | Take Out 207-846-3436 | Pound 
<br>
207-846-5871<br>
http://www.dayscrabmeatandlobster.com/menu.html
<br><br>
Bowes Street Market (See grocery stores)
<br><br>
Shaws Market  (See grocery stores)
<br><br>
Allen's Seafood in Harpswell (at the warf) and Cantrell's Seafood in Topsham are also popular places for buying lobster and other fresh seafood. (But a bit further away.)</p>
                <br>

                <p class='questionHeading'>Which area restaurants in the area do you suggest?</p>

<p id='faqAnswer'>Freeport is home to several good restaurants but as ownership and management often changes, we suggest looking up current reviews on Tripadvisor.com. Since it doesn't take long to get to Brunswick via the back roads, (see google maps) you may also want to check out eateries Brunswick has to offer as well.</P>
                <br>

                <p class='questionHeading'>Where can I rent an extra kayak?</p>

                <p class='questionHeading'>May I hold a wedding on the property?</p>

<p id='faqAnswer'>We are often asked this question and are grateful that our property is wedding worthy!  Unfortunately due to the septic system and neighborhood restrictions, our cottage cannot accommodate any large groups. (Weddings may be held at nearby Wolfe's Neck Farm.)
                <br><br>

                <p class='questionHeading'>Do I need to bring anything for my week?</p>

<p id='faqAnswer'>Food:
<br>
Linens, paper products, cleaning products, soaps and laundry detergent are supplied.  Just bring food. Feel free to use up any items in cupboard (coffees, tea, canned goods and cooking items left behind by guests we leave for others who may want to use them.)   
<br><br>
Jackets:
<br>
In summer time the peninsula can be much cooler than town due to the surrounding water temperature, so we recommend you bring jackets warmer than you would typically think needed for that time of year.  
<br><br>
Bikes are provided. However, if you chose to bring your own bike, you may store it in the locked shed.</p>
